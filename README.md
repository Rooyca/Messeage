## What is Messeage?
The name comes from a play on words that unites `message` and `sea`, referring to the messages that were sent in glass bottles through the sea. And we could say that it is an RPG in which users are isolated people (in every sense of the word) who are on the shore of our small island waiting for the arrival of messenger bottles. When we receive one of those we have two options, read it and return it to the sea (pressing the tide icon) or read it and rescue it (pressing the lifeguard icon).

It should be noted that this application has NO use and is merely an attempt to show how ridiculous the "interaction" is today on the Internet. Little by little we have become subjects addicted to attention, we want the whole world to know our habits, our diet, our mood, etc. We want to show at all costs how beautiful our lifestyle is, and how do we do it? Throwing bottles with messages (true or false) to the web. 

We are addicted to numbers, we want to know how important we are, what is our value (5k... 10k... 20k!?) And the worst thing is that we are not able to separate reality from fiction, these systems have become so addictive and are so well designed that they got deep into our brain and ate away, in large part, our ability to think rationally...

We want to be *saved*, i.e. get attention, at any cost and we will get it no matter who we pass through. The Internet (social networks more than anything) has become a competition to see how far we are able to go for a few views or likes. 

We have to be like the great influencers, those people who are role models for many. We look at the number of followers and say: "Wow, how great is Fulanito58 hopefully one day I can be like him!" and seeing that we are not going to achieve it we get depressed and believe that the world is just that; fame, money and attention.

## To keep in mind

I am no an expert, neither in web design, nor in psychology, nor in anything. This is simply the (half-heartedly) development of an idea that came to me from one moment to the next... Reality punching me in the face.
